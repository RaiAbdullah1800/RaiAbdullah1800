# 👋 Hey, I'm Rai Abdullah Nawaz  

> *Machine Learning Engineer • Full-Stack Developer • AI Problem Solver*

I’m the kind of developer who loves building things that *actually think*.  
From deploying ML pipelines with **FastAPI + React**, to experimenting with **client-side ML (TensorFlow.js / ml5.js)** — I bring machine learning right into the hands of users.

Currently working as a **Machine Learning Engineer @ SmartZoneLeaders**, where I design and deploy intelligent full-stack web apps that don’t just look good… they *learn*.

## 🚀 What I Build

🧠 **Machine Learning & AI Systems**
- Real-world ML pipelines (Python, FastAPI, scikit-learn, OpenCV, Hugging Face)
- Generative AI & RAG systems (LangChain, Groq, Hugging Face)
- On-device / browser-based ML (TensorFlow.js, ml5.js, Teachable Machine)

⚙️ **Full Stack Web Apps**
- Frontend: React.js, Zustand, Ant Design, Vite  
- Backend: FastAPI, Node.js, Express  
- Databases: MongoDB, MySQL  
- CI/CD: Render, Railway, AWS EC2, Netlify  

🌐 **End-to-End Product Development**
- Intelligent dashboards & analytics
- Microservice architectures
- Voice + Chat AI Integrations

## ⚡ Fun Fact

I believe a well-built API is poetry — clean, expressive, and slightly over-engineered (for love, not necessity).
